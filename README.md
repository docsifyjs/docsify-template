# Docsify Template

> A simple [Docsify](https://github.com/docsifyjs/docsify/) template for creating Markdown-based documentation sites, with no build process required.

## Site Setup

The quickest way to get a Docsify site up and running is with GitHub Pages:  

1. Log into GitHub if you have not done so already
2. Tap the **Use this template** button in the upper-right of this GitHub Repository and choose **Create a new repository**
3. Enter a name for your new Repository and then tap the **Create repository** button
4. Once your new Repostitory is created go to **Settings**, then select **Pages** from the left-hand sidebar, and under **Branch** choose **main** and then tap the **Save** button
5. Wait a minute or two and refresh the same **Pages** page - once your site is ready a message will be displayed at the top of the screen along with a site link and a **Visit site** button

Alternatively, upload the files to any static web server. Or run `npx serve .` (Node.js users) or `python -m http.server 8000` (Python users) in the repo to serve run locally.

## Editing Content

How about editing the content of your new Docsify site? All you need to do is edit a source Markdown page (for example,  **README.md**) by viewing that page and tapping the **Pencil Icon**, then saving any changes by tapping the green **Commit changes...** button. In just a few moments the Docsify site will be automatically updated to reflect those changes!
